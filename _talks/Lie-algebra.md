# Chapter 1 Basic Concepts

## 1.Definitions and first examples

> <font color=red>Definition.</font> A vector space $L$ over a field $F$, with an operation $L \times L \rightarrow L$, denote $(x,y)\mapsto [x,y]$and called the bracket or commutator of $x$ and $y$ , is called a Lie algebra over $F$ if the following axioms are satisfied: 
  * The bracket operation is bilinear.
  * $[x,x]=0$ for all $x$ in $L$.
  * $[x,[y,z]]+[y,[z,x]]+[z,[x,y]]=0,(x,y,z\in L)$.
